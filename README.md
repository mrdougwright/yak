ðŸ¦§> What's a good name for a chat app?
ðŸ¤–: How about "Yak"? It's short, and yaks are fluffy like llamas!
```

## LLM Models

Ensure Ollama server is running.
```bash
ollama list
```
You should see something like,
```bash
NAME               ID              SIZE      MODIFIED
llama3:instruct    365c0bd3c000    4.7 GB    25 hours ago
gemma3:1b          8648f39daa8f    815 MB    59 minutes ago
```

You can change models in the `config.json` file.

```json
{
  "model": "gemma3:1b"
}
```

### Log Management

Don't like the chat? All messages are logged to chatlog.jsonl

To reset the log:
```bash
node chat.js --reset
```
